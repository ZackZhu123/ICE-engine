title: Procedure
---

- Before the engines are started, make sure that you have identified all the relevant instruments and controls. In particular, follow the routes taken by air and fuel on their way to the engines and note how the engine is coupled to the dynamometer and how the load is adjusted.

- The engines will be run at one, or two throttle settings (corresponding to a fixed accelerator position whilst driving a car) at these fixed settings, the engine speed will be varied only by changing the load (i.e. torque) applied by the dynamometer (this corresponds to the gradient of the road changing).

- Use the logging software (the tutor will show you how to use this) to record, at least, the engine speed, the fuel and air flowrates, the barometric pressure and the inlet air temperature.

- Normally, each group of three or four students will take the measurements on only one of the two engines, then exchange data for analysis.
