### Aims and objectives of the experiment

The educational aims of this experiment are:
 - To provide practical experience of a power plant and the means to measure its performance
 - To demonstrate the operation of reciprocating internal-combustion engines on test beds
 - To provide experience of measuring the following quantities: torque, power, flow rate
 - To support the teaching of the following topics in Thermodynamics: processes and cycles; heat and work transfers; 1st Law; properties of gases; cycle effi- ciency; Diesel & Otto cycles and practical measures of engine performance
 - To provide limited additional experience in writing a technical report (following the procedures learnt in the ME1 Experimental Reporting Skills course)

The objectives can be stated simply as:

To determine and compare the principal performance characteristics of two 4-stroke engines, one compression-ignition (CI) and one spark-ignition (SI), as a function of speed at constant throttle settings
