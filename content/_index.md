This website contains information relating to the internal combustion performance experiment that forms part of the ME1 and ME2 Thermofluids L aboratories. The experiments are designed to reinforce concepts in Thermodynamics with particular reference to the Steady Flow Energy Equation and Efficiency.

### Instrumentation

The quantities to be measured are shaft speed, torque, air flow rate and fuel flow rate.

#### Shaft speed

The tachometer on each engine uses a magnetic sensor whose pulses are converted to rev/min.

#### Torque

This is a trunnion mounted eddy current dynamometer rated at 150 kW between 2800 and 8000 rpm and a maximum torque rating of 500 Nm. The dynamometer unit comprises basically of a rotor mounted on a shaft running in bearings which rotates within a casing supported in ball bearing trunnions which form part of the bed plate of the dynamometer. Secured in the casing two field coils are connected in series. When these coils are supplied with a Direct Current (DC) a magnetic field is created in the casing across the air gap at either side of the rotor. When the rotor turns in this magnetic field, eddy currents are induced creating a braking effect between the rotor and casing. The rotational torque exerted on the casing is measured by a strain gauge load cell incorporated in the restraining linkage between the casing and dynamometer bed plate.
To prevent overheating of the dynamometer a pressurised water supply is connected to a flanged inlet on the dynamometer bed plate. Water passes from the inlet to the casing via a flexible connection; permitting movement of the casing. Water passes through loss (grooved) plates in the casing positioned either side of the rotor and absorbs the heat generated. Heated water discharges from the casing through a flexible connection to an outlet flange on the bed plate.

#### Air Flow Rate

The engines are fitted with a ’laminar element’ flow meter, where the constriction is formed by a bundle of small parallel tubes fitted inside a large-diameter duct (imagine drinking straws in a box). The flow inside each small tube is known to be laminar, and laminar flow theory (as in the ME1 TF Fluid Mechanics lectures) enables the velocity profile in the tubes to be derived as a function of the pressure drop. From this, a mean velocity in each tube and hence the total air flow rate can be found. (Note: Bernoulli’s equation is not applicable here, since the flow in the small tubes is completely dominated by viscous effects).

#### Fuel flow rate

The flow of fuel is measured using a small turbine flowmeter and is displayed in Litre/min. At the heart of this device is a small turbine mounted on saphire bearings which rotates with a speed that is proportional to the flowrate. As the turbine rotates it interrupts a high intensity infra-red beam and produces a stream of pulses the frequency of which are converted to a flowrate.
